## Introduction

This is the second portfolio project from the Full Stake Engineer Path on Codecademy. The project goal is to create a portfolio website to catalog and show off my latest coding projects. This website will use current understanding of front end web development, and will change over time to include new styles/features learned along the way.

## Technologies

This project uses HTML and CSS  language to code the program, and markdown language to formal the README.md file. Visual Studio Code is the text editor utilized along with the use of Bash Terminal and GitHub Remote Repositories.


## Project status

Finished the initial website design on April 26, 2022.

## Future

As mentioned, the website will be updated with future portfolio projects, and I am hoping to incorporate more advanced styling to the webpage in the future.
